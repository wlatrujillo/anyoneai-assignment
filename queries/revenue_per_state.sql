-- TODO: 
-- This query will return a table with two columns: customer_state and Revenue. 
-- The first one will have the letters that identify the top 10 states 
-- with most revenue and the second one the total revenue of each.

-- HINT: 
-- All orders should have a delivered status and the actual delivery date should be not null.
